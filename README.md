# OpenMRS Test Automation Project

This project includes automation tests for essential user operations on the OpenMRS (Open Medical Record System) platform. Tests are written using **TestNG** and the **Page Object Model** architecture. User stories are implemented based on the demo environment provided at [openmrs.org](https://openmrs.org).
